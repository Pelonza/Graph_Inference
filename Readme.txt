This code is developed with no guarantee of success. 
At last testing, all algorithms ran on basic graph files, in NetBean

The arguments for adjustable paths do not seem to be implemented correctly.

Notes: This was/is current a net-bean's project, and so has all the 
sub-files included in the net-beans run path. Correct path directions will
need to be provided for both algorithms and graphs if using "graphinfer.py" 
as a standalone program (or move everything into one directory).

A rough sample of how to plot using python's matplotlib is in "Graphing_Example.py"
It will need to be heavily modified before being used (currently set for 8 algorithms)

FDD.py and barabasi.gexf are included in main folder to allow test run of 
graphinfer.py
