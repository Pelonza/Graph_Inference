This code is developed with no guarantee of success. 
At last testing, all algorithms ran on basic graph files.

Notes: This was/is current a net-bean's project, and so has all the 
sub-files included in the net-beans run path. Correct path directions will
need to be provided for both algorithms and graphs if using "graphinfer.py" 
as a standalone program (or move everything into one directory).
